"""The S1U robot node's specification (user 11-13: "任意一台s1u机器人新进来，和之前的都是一样的……百台机器人要完全
一致"): every item a robot x86 must agree on with every other, who makes it so, and whether this node conforms. The
node tuner (node_tuner.py) evaluates it every minute and publishes on its Node

    label       rlark.io/node-conformance             ok | not-ok
    annotation  rlark.io/node-conformance-report      each item that does not hold, with who converges it
    annotation  rlark.io/node-fingerprint-model       the same on every S1U of every site
    annotation  rlark.io/node-fingerprint-site        the same on every robot of a site
    annotation  rlark.io/node-fingerprint-body        the same on every robot of a body type
    annotation  rlark.io/node-facts                   the values the fingerprints are of
    annotation  rlark.io/node-spec                    the digest of this file and the node profile

A fingerprint is of configuration that should be equal, never of what is one node's (its name, addresses, serial
numbers, host keys) or changes by itself (a clock's offset, whether the Orin answers): the latter decide conformance
only. An item belongs to exactly one mechanism, which alone holds its expected value:

    node-profile    the node tuner makes the host follow node_profile.env (node_profile.sh status)
    orin, clock     the tuner Pod's other containers (their state labels)
    vendor          delivered with the robot; nobody converges it, EXPECTED states the one version in use
    admission       the labels RLark puts on the Node from the robot's admission record
    installer, station, registry-trust   RLark's; each says on the Node what it wants and whether it holds
                    (REFERENCES), and this file repeats neither its values nor its checks

Standard library only."""
