"""Each S1U robot's x86 keeps its own Orin (user 11-12/13: nobody logs into an Orin, nothing is done per machine): a
container of the node tuner's Pod (Addon s1u-robot), on every S1U robot x86. Every minute it logs into the robot's
Orin over the robot's internal network (S1U_ORIN_IP_ADDRESS, the same on every robot) and makes it what the Addon
declares:

- the x86's uplink through the Orin (s1u-orin-uplink.service: forwarding and masquerade for the x86's address, there
  from the Orin's boot), as this image has it; the Orin's uplink addresses written for the node profile's rules
  (none is the x86's, none is of the robot's own network). Units the Addon retires (orinRetiredUnits: the same
  uplink under an earlier name) are stopped and removed, and this one started again at once, since stopping such a
  unit deletes the forwarding rules both of them hold;
- the cameras' USB rule (their devices the account's), and on request a USB reset of the cameras as the Orin's
  account: the robot's device layer writes /run/rlark/s1u/camera-reset-request on the host ({"id", "cameras"}) when
  it restarted the vendor's camera driver and still had no frames; each id is done once, while nothing marks the
  host in use, and the result written to /run/rlark/s1u/camera-reset-result and as an Event on the Node;
- a vendor process that must not run there (the profile's S1U_ORIN_STOPPED) ended at every pass, and the line that
  starts it in the vendor's start script (S1U_ORIN_STOPPED_LAUNCHER) commented out;
- the site's adb key the headsets trust (the secret's adb_key, if it holds one) as ~/.android/adbkey_rlark;
- the payloads the Addon declares (orinPayloads, "NAME=IMAGE,..."): each image's /payload directory, copied into
  this Pod by an init container, as ~/rl/NAME.<hash of its files> on the Orin with ~/rl/NAME a link to it (the hash
  is the version). A payload's own script ``install`` places what only root can (its units, its USB rules) and
  starts it: run through sudo as ``install`` after a new version is unpacked, ``install restart`` when the link is
  switched to it, ``install remove`` when the payload is no longer declared. It finds the robot's addresses and the
  account in rlark.env beside it. A new version is switched to only while nothing marks the host in use (a Station
  attached to the device layer: a restart of a payload may end what it serves) and the robot's wave of the rollout
  allows (/run/rlark/s1u/rollout, the node tuner's word).
RLark depends on a payload's image reference only, never on what it is made of.

The login is one site-level set in the Addon's secret (orinAccessSecret), mounted in memory at /orin-access:
ssh_key (the x86's key to the Orin), password (the Orin account's, also sudo's) and, optionally, adb_key. A new Orin
does not have the key yet: the first login is by password (ssh's own SSH_ASKPASS, whose helper reads the mounted
file) and adds the key's public line to authorized_keys. The password is written to sudo's standard input and is in
no argument, environment variable, log or file of this container's making.

The Orin's ssh host key is trusted on first use and kept on this robot's Node (annotation s1u.rlark.io/orin-host-key,
written here, kept by the cluster across a reinstalled x86). Once it differs, nothing more is sent to that address,
the state says identity_changed with both fingerprints, and a person confirms the new one by setting the Node's
annotation s1u.rlark.io/orin-host-key-confirm to the presented fingerprint (through RLark: whoever may write the
robot's Node may confirm). Every trust is recorded: the annotation s1u.rlark.io/orin-host-key-trust and an Event.

The state is on the Node: label s1u.rlark.io/orin-state, one word: ok | updating | no_access (the secret is not in the
cluster yet) | unreachable | login_failed | identity_changed | failed; with the Addon's profile=removed, removing (the
host is marked in use) | removed (remove: nothing of the Addon's is left there); annotation s1u.rlark.io/orin, the
whole state as JSON (reachable, identity, trust, fingerprints, serial, payloads, the last camera reset, failures).

Standard library and the image's ssh only."""
