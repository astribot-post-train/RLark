# Moves the data of a node made before its volumes were declared into them
# (bootstrap/volumes.sh), from the cluster's API, without logging in to it:
#
#   node-volumes.sh KUBECONFIG NODE VOLUMES IMAGE [undo|confirm]
#
#   VOLUMES  as a node is admitted with them (NODE_VOLUMES):
#            "kubelet=60G:/var/lib/kubelet,runtime=150G:/var/lib/containerd-fleet"
#   IMAGE    the installer bundle (extensions/station/bootstrap/build.sh)
#
# The node stops while its data is copied, as for a reboot: its kubelet, its
# container runtime and every container of it; a control plane's API is away
# with them. Its pods start again on it. Nothing else of the cluster is
# touched. The data as it was stays beside each path on the node until
# "confirm" removes it; "undo" goes back to it before that (what pods wrote
# into the volumes since is lost). A move that fails on the node goes back by
# itself. Environment: PULL_SECRET, JOB_NAMESPACE (kube-system), TIMEOUT (1800 s).
