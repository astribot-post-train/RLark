#   upgrade-cluster.sh KUBECONFIG VERSION IMAGE

#   IMAGE  the upgrade bundle of VERSION (extensions/station/bootstrap/build.sh):
#          kubeadm, kubelet, kubectl and every image the version's control
#          plane and nodes run, so that no node needs the internet.
# Order, as kubeadm prescribes: each control-plane node, then every other node,
# one at a time, after the certificates of each control-plane node have been
# completed for the node's present addresses: etcd snapshot (control plane) -> kubeadm upgrade -> drain ->
# kubelet -> confirm -> back to its previous scheduling state. The kubelet
# phase leaves a watchdog on the node that puts the old kubelet back after
# WATCHDOG_SECONDS (600) unless this script, having seen the node Ready at
# VERSION, confirms: a node whose new kubelet does not start, or whose upgrade
# lost this session, returns by itself (cordoned, as the drain left it). It stops at the first
# failed check. What a node replaced is kept on it in
# /var/backups/rlark-kube-upgrade/<old version>/, the snapshot too
# (etcd-snapshot.db). ROLLBACK=yes with the old version as VERSION and the
# image of the failed upgrade takes the worker nodes back, after the control
# plane has been taken back on its node (upgrade.sh, PHASE=rollback).
# Environment: PULL_SECRET (name of an image pull secret) and JOB_NAMESPACE
# (where it is and the Jobs run; kube-system), NODES, WATCHDOG_SECONDS;
# MANAGEMENT_KUBECONFIG and MANAGEMENT_NAMESPACE for a cluster under an RLark
# agent (the management plane and the cluster's namespace in it).
